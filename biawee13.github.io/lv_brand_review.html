	<a href="http://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/homepage"> Louis Vuitton</a>.  When you hear the name, you think of luxury, prestige, and that iconic monogram.  Founded in 1854, Louis Vuitton as a brand has solidified its position in the fashion world and amongst handbag aficionados as one of the top three fashion houses—with Chanel and Hermes rounding out the three. 
	</p>

	<p class="p">
	Luxury and prestige are practically synonymous with the brand as the quality of their goods reflect highly—very highly on the price tag.  Prices for Louis Vuitton small leather goods and handbags range from $200 for their canvas <a href="http://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/products/key-pouch-monogram-000941">Key Pouch</a> to around $52,000 USD for an exotic leather <a href="http://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/products/capucines-mm-crocodile-brillant-012070"> Capucines PM</a>.

	<p class="p"> 
	Many might say two-hundred dollars for a small piece of canvas (not even leather) that holds keys or coins is severely overpriced—they have a very valid point, however, if you’ve got a great appreciation for the brands history and high-quality pieces or even if you’re just obsessed with the brand, if you can afford it, that is a small price to pay to fill that hole in every handbag lovers heart.  
	</p>

	<p class="p">
	Louis Vuitton handbags are, to some people, merely status symbols of wealth, but to some it is a wise investment piece.  Depending on the condition and the model, a person can resell their piece for 75% or over 100% of the price they paid for it, even it is a vintage piece purchased two decades ago.  Let’s say you bought a Neverfull MM in the classic Monogram Canvas in 1990 for $500 USD and you kept it in near perfect condition, you could resell that piece for close to its current asking price which is now $1,260 USD – leading to a 200% return on investment. Whether they are planning to use it for personal use or to put it up for sale on the handbag resale market, Louis Vuitton pieces have quality that lasts upwards of 20 years with good care.
