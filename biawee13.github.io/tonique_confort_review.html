	<!--<h1 class="h1"> Why K-Beauty is Booming </h1> -->

	<p class="p">
		If Korea is king of skin care, France would be the queen.  France is home to some of the best, most effective skin care there is.  French beauty standards call for more natural beauty—less makeup, preferable almost none at all except to highlight good natural features.  To wear less makeup, the French innovate and develop skin care to help them reach those ends.
	</p>

	<p class="p">
		Korean skin care is mentioned on this website in one or more other posts, but now I want to get into some other skin care brands – today’s brand is <a href="https://www.lancome-usa.com/"> Lancome </a>.   
	</p>

	<p class="p">
		If you haven’t already guessed from the intro, Lancome is a luxury French brand of skin care, cosmetics, and fragrances.  It was founded in 1935 by Guillaume d’Ornano and Armand Petitjean originally as a fragrance house, then later the company became part of L’Oreal Paris’s luxury line of brands and it is now one of the leading luxury brands in the world.

	<p class="p">
		Lancome has hundreds of products that it has released, so it’s impossible to review them all unless you have way to much time on your hands, and beauty products take a lot more time to review as you have to see the long term effects it can have.  
	</p>

	<p class="p">
		Judging simply from the products that I do have, and I believe that I have a decent amount and ratio of their skin care and makeup products, Lancome has got to be my favorite western beauty brand.  Their products are not only luxuriously packaged, but you can feel the quality and the luxury as soon as you swatch or smooth the product onto your skin. 
	</p>

	<p class="p"> 
		As a higher-end brand, it can get very expensive to purchase and repurchase products from their line, but in my opinion, it is absolutely worth it.  Using their products, you don’t feel as if your paying more for just the packaging (well, you are paying more for that too), but you’re actually getting products made with quality ingredients and with your skin in mind.
