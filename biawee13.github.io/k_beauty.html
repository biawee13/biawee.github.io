	<!--<h1 class="h1"> Why K-Beauty is Booming </h1> -->

	<p class="p">

	K-Beauty, or Korean Beauty, is becoming more and more of a trend here in the United States. It originates from South Korea, the epicenter of amazing skin care.  It has spread to the west as more people are reaping the benefits of this tried and true formula of product layering.

	<p class="p"> 

	Typically, the basics of skin care regimen consists of: wash, tone, and moisturize – and that’s it.  In the Korean skin care regimen, there can be upwards of 10 steps including, but not limited to: oil cleanser, foam cleanser, exfoliate, toner, essence, serum, boosters, ampoule, sheet mask, eye cream, moisturizer, SPF, and finishing mist. 
	You may ask: what is the point of having so many steps? Don’t you only need moisturizer? There is a point to having every single step as each product, each phase, does something different, but they all work together to benefit your skin.

	<p class="p">

	Now, you don’t have to have every single product or every single step in the Korean skin care regimen to have perfect skin—some people achieve perfect skin even if they only wash their face with water alone. For most of us who don’t have perfect skin, following in the example of this extensive routine can bring us a little closer to a better complexion.  
	Most people don’t have the time or the budget to get on board with a 10+ product regimen, but expanding your daily skin care routine to cleansing (double cleanse if you wear makeup), toning, essence, serum, moisturizer, and finishing mist can make all the difference. It’s 3 or 4 more steps to add, but completely worth it.

	<p class="p">

	You should use whatever skin care brand or product that works well for your particular skin type, however, another part of K-beauty is using Korean skin care products from brands such as <a href="https://tonymoly.us/"> Tony Moly </a> or <a href="https://www.sk-ii.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrZmyhq-F2AIVkCWBCh2IWwEIEAAYASAAEgJdQfD_BwE"> SK-II </a>.  Just like with western brands, there is a low end and a high end when it comes to pricing, however, the low end of Korean skin care has the same effect of mid to high end wester skin care – as to the reason for this, there is no definite answer, but it goes to show why South Korea is the place to be for skin care.
